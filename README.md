**Definition** : K-means is an unsupervised learning method for clustering data points. The algorithm iteratively divides data points into K clusters by minimizing the variance in each cluster.
**How it works** : First, each data point is randomly assigned to one of the K clusters. Then, we compute the centroid (functionally the center) of each cluster, and reassign each data point to the cluster with the closest centroid. We repeat this process until the cluster assignments for each data point are no longer changing.
K-means clustering requires us to select K, the number of clusters we want to group the data into.
